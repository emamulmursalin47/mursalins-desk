  {
    q: "Can I upgrade my package mid-project?",
    a: "Absolutely. If your requirements grow, we can seamlessly upgrade to a higher tier. You'll only pay the difference between tiers, and the work already completed carries over.",
  },
  {
    q: "What payment methods do you accept?",
    a: "I accept bank transfers, PayPal, and Wise. Payment is typically split into milestones — a deposit upfront and the remainder on delivery.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do prices include ongoing support?",
    a: "Every package includes a support period after delivery (duration varies by tier). Extended maintenance and support plans are available separately.",
  },
  {
    q: "What happens after the project is delivered?",
    a: "You receive all source code, documentation, and deployment credentials. I'll walk you through the handoff and remain available during the support period for any questions or fixes.",
  },
  {
    q: "What if my project doesn't fit these packages?",
    a: "These packages cover the most common project types. For unique requirements, reach out via the contact page and I'll put together a custom proposal tailored to your needs.",
  },
